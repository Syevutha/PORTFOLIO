<p>The lesson was really creative and fun and I'm trying to practice what I alearnt it is not quite difficult but it requires practice a lot of practice.<i>The instructor was called John</i><br>However the noise from the chat was really a lot and the notifications kept coming and coming and it was honestly really annoying <br>The fact that most people just go on to ask the same qustions is really realy annoying and it just goes to show that people don't put in a lot of effort to listening as much as they should be .That is very very annoying.</p>
